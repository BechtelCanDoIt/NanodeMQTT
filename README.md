NanodeMQTT
==========

Implementation of [MQTT] for the [Nanode]. MQTT is a lightweight PubSub protocol.
Nanode is an open source Arduino-like board that has in-built internet connectivity.


Requirements
------------

* [NanodeUIP] - [uIP] stack for Nanode
* [NanodeUNIO] - MAC address reading for Nanode


Limitations
-----------

- Maximum packet size is 127 bytes
- Currently only possible to reliably subscribe to a single topic
- Only QOS 0 supported


Questions
---------

* Should the public API calls block?
  - connect()
  - subscribe()
  - publish()
* What is the best approach to error handling?
 - Is it a good idea to print debug messages to Serial?
* What assumptions is it safe to make to reduce complexity?
 - Should we bother waiting for SUBACK?
* When/how to auto-reconnect?
* How to analyse RAM / programme usage and optimise?
* How to close previous TCP session after resetting the AVR?


TODO
----

* Add licensing information
* Switch to using switch()
* Make better use of the uIP appstate memory
* Add a new timed out state?
* Time-out if SUBACK isn't received?
* Implement auto-reconnect
* Look at removing some buffers
* Get DNS working in example
* Assert that UIP buffers are big enough
* Memory usage optimisations (especially RAM)
* Implement Wills
* Improve subscribing to multiple topics
* Make a State Machine diagram
* Separate out UIP code, so that it works with plain [Contiki].
* Implement unsubscribe (?)
* Provide callback for periodic publishes?
